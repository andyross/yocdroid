BUGS:

+ There is no way to "stop" the environment.  The bind mounts won't
  unmount until all the processes using them are killed.  Consider
  placing them all in a cgroup a-la systemd...

+ The kernel initrd rootfs cannot be bind mounted.  So the yocdroid
  chroot has no access to it (it's read-only and non-persistent, of
  course, but sometimes it's nice to check what the init.rc said for
  the current system).

+ The mount copies are static and don't track changes to the
  filesystem (e.g. app asec mounts, user switching.  Amusingly the
  sdcard virtual filesystem works fine as the FUSE mount is static...)
  automatically.  This could be handled with a small daemon listening
  on a netlink socket.

+ There is no integration with the Android user/group IDs.  Everything
  but root appears as a numeric ID to the linux personality.
  Amusingly, the list is statically defined (in C code!) in
  system/core/include/private/android_filesystem_config.h.  This list
  should be merged with the core IDs in the base-passwd package.

+ The procps utilities (uptime is the most obvious to test) report a
  warning of "Unknown HZ value! (xx) Assume 100."  Frustratingly
  google results for this error are dominated by discussion of a few
  rootkits which install stale procps versions which trigger the
  warning and don't detail the actual issue.

+ On a default android device, the nosuid flag for /data is inherited
  by the bind mount, so suid binaries won't work.  For remote access
  via a root shell that's fine that's fine, but local access from an
  app (e.g. Term.apk) context requires a working su.  It also prevents
  many utilities (e.g. ping) from running as non-root users.

+ gdb doesn't seem to understand threads.  With ps -eLf I can see
  multiple threads, but "thread 2" in the attached process gives me
  nothing (I can attach to the thread's tid directly, however).  Is
  it relying on a pthread/nptl implementation that bionic doesn't
  do?

+ (MAYBE FIXED) The /etc/mtab file should be a link to /proc/mounts
  but isn't

+ (MAYBE FIXED) syslog doesn't work due to a filesystem namespace
  collision.  On android "/dev/log" is a directory, not a syslog
  socket.  This is defined in eglibc as _PATH_LOG in a header, and I
  think that should be sufficient to fix it.

+ (MAYBE FIXED) Even so, /proc/kmsg doesn't duplicate messages, so no
  kernel logging for syslog.  The klogd component needs to be disabled
  when starting syslogd.

+ (MAYBE FIXED) acpid won't start without the /etc/acpi/events
  directory being present

+ (MAYBE FIXED) gdb doesn't understand the android linker paths, and
  android binaries don't use RPATH to tell it.  Use "set
  solib-search-path /system/lib" to work around.  This should work in
  an /etc/gdbinit file, but that has to be configured at build time
  with --with-system-gdbinit

+ (FIXED) Not all of the /etc/rc3.d links are safe to execute, so we
  can't start at boot.

+ (FIXED) There is no bootstrap procedure for root authentication.
  Should maybe require a root password in local.conf (and error if
  it's unset), or copy the build user's ssh public key...

+ (FIXED) /etc/profile et. al. need to add /system/{bin,xbin} to the PATH

+ (FIXED) The environment pruning is too aggressive.  Some android
  variables should be preserved...
