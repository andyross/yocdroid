BUGS:

+ The mount copies are static and don't track changes to the
  filesystem (e.g. app asec mounts, user switching.  Amusingly the
  sdcard virtual filesystme works fine as the FUSE mount is static...)
  automatically.  This could be handled with a small daemon listening
  on a netlink socket.

+ There is no integration with the Android user/group IDs.  Everything
  but root appears as a numeric ID to the linux personality.
  Amusingly, the list is statically defined (in C code!) in
  system/core/include/private/android_filesystem_config.h.  Just cook
  that into a /etc/passwd file.

+ (MAYBE FIXED) The /etc/mtab file should be a link to /proc/mounts
  but isn't

+ uptime reports "Unknown HZ value! (xx) Assume 100."

+ (MAYBE FIXED) syslog doesn't work due to a filesystem namespace
  collision.  On android "/dev/log" is a directory, not a syslog
  socket.  This is defined in eglibc as _PATH_LOG in a header, and I
  think that should be sufficient to fix it.

+ Even so, /proc/kmsg doesn't duplicate messages, so no kernel
  logging for syslog.  The klogd component needs to be disabled when
  starting syslogd.

+ The nosuid flag for /data is inherited by the bind mount, so suid
  binaries won't work.  For remote access via a root shell in adb
  that's fine, but local access from an app (e.g. Term.apk) context
  requires a working su.

+ Passwordless root login in sshd is borked somehow; you have to set a
  password with /usr/bin/passwd or add a key.  Frankly this is
  probably for the best.

+ acpid won't start without the /etc/acpi/events directory being present

+ gdb doesn't understand the android linker paths, and android
  binaries don't use RPATH to tell it.  Use "set solib-search-path
  /system/lib" to work around.  This should work in an /etc/gdbinit
  file, but it didn't for me the first time I tried.

+ gdb doesn't seem to understand threads.  With ps -eLf I can see
  multiple threads, but "thread 2" in the attached process gives me
  nothing (I can attach to the thread's tid directly, however).  Is
  it relying on a pthread/nptl implementation that bionic doesn't
  do?

+ /etc/profile et. al. need to add /system/{bin,xbin} to the PATH

+ The environment pruning is too aggressive.  Some android variables
  should be preserved...
