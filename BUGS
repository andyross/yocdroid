BUGS:

+ No meaningful effort has been made to secure the installation.
  There are no known holes (it lives in /data/y, which is not writable
  to apps), but for the moment it's safest to assume that a clever
  downloaded app will be able to bootstrap local root access if
  yocdroid is installed.

+ The installation (but not runtime) process depends on a busybox tar
  and bzip2.

+ The kernel initrd rootfs cannot be bind mounted.  So the yocdroid
  chroot has no access to it (it's read-only and non-persistent, of
  course, but sometimes it's nice to check what the init.rc said for
  the current system).  Maybe make copies of the files in root and
  bind mount subdirectories?

+ There is no integration with the Android user/group IDs.  Everything
  but root appears as a numeric ID to the linux personality.

+ The procps utilities (uptime is the most obvious to test) report a
  warning of "Unknown HZ value! (xx) Assume 100."  Frustratingly
  google results for this error are dominated by discussion of a few
  rootkits which install stale procps versions which trigger the
  warning and don't detail the actual issue.

+ On a default android device, the nosuid flag for /data is inherited
  by the bind mount, so suid binaries won't work.  For remote access
  via a root shell that's fine, but local access from an app
  (e.g. Term.apk) context requires a working su.  It also prevents
  many utilities (e.g. ping) from running as non-root users.

+ AOSP "su" appears not to propagate failed result codes to the parent
  process, so the installer is fragile on those systems -- everything
  seems to work even if it doesn't.  Systems (e.g Cyanogenmod) using
  Superuser.apk's su binary do the right thing.

+ The Yocto atd daemon is installed but not started.  It's initscript
  lacks the proper header.
