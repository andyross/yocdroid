The gdb_thread_db.h file is GNU software distributed as part of gdb
under the GPLv3.  The original libthread_db.c file is AOSP software
distributed in AOSP under BSD terms.

Whether the modifications required to port the latter to the former,
and the resulting work, constitute "derived works" of GNU gdb is for
someone else to say.  Note that the glibc libthread_db.so.1
implentation, using the same interface, is distributed under the
LGPLv3.
