You will need a Poky linux tree in the local directory (a symlink
works fine) as "./poky".  You can get this from the upstream git with:

    git clone git://git.yoctoproject.org/poky

Building an x86 image is as simple as "make".  The output tarball will
appear in tmp/deploy/images.  Simply unpack this under /data/y on your
Android device.

If you want to work directly with bitbake, the Makefile will create a
"bbwrap" wrapper script for you ("make bbwrap") which sets up the
environment correctly and then launches bitbake.  So e.g. "./bbwrap -c
devshell my-package-name" does what you want.

You may edit the installed package list in
recipes/yocdroid-image/yocdroid-image.bb.  The IMAGE_FEATURES
mechanism from Yocto works as well, but be careful with it because
many of the existing default package lists tend to pull in unwanted
dependencies.
