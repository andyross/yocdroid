Yocdroid is a Linux userspace environment for use on Android devices
based on the Yocto Linux Project's distribution build system.

With it, you can have a (more or less) fully integratied "real" Linux
command line environment on your Android machine without losing the
ability to interoperate with the core Android world.  For example:

+ bash, perl, python, ssh, nc, curl, wget.  Cron jobs!  Hook /etc/rc.local!

+ Terminals spawned from ssh instead of adb understand SIGWINCH and
  get proper settings for LINES/COLUMNS.

+ Run lspci/lsusb to get human-readable output.

+ Run acpid/acpi_listen to inspect firmware events.

+ Run android stuff: "getprop ro.whatever", "pm install
  something.apk", "am start ...".  Script activity and intent
  management using robust tools.

+ Attach gdb or strace to an android process.

+ netstat, iptables

+ {TODO} tcpdump

+ {TODO} Launch a dalvik app under valgrind with "valgrind app_process ..."

+ {TODO} Mount the android filesystem locally via sshfs

+ {TODO} Find your device on any local network via Avahi/Zeroconf
  ("avahi-browse -a", "ssh ydroid-ivb-andy.local")
