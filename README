Yocdroid is a Linux userspace environment for use on Android devices
based on the Yocto Linux Project's distribution build system.

With it, you can have a (more or less) fully integratied "real" Linux
command line environment on your Android machine without losing the
ability to interoperate with the core Android world.  For example:

+ bash, perl, python, ssh, nc, curl, wget.  Cron jobs!  Hook
  /etc/rc.local!  Use "file" on unknown data.

+ Find your device on any local network via Avahi/Zeroconf
  ("avahi-browse -a", "ssh andy-ivb.local")

+ Terminals spawned from ssh instead of adb understand SIGWINCH and
  get proper settings for LINES/COLUMNS.  No more broken terminal
  output.

+ Run lspci/lsusb to get human-readable output.

+ Run acpid/acpi_listen to inspect firmware events.

+ Android stuff works like you expect: "getprop ro.whatever", "pm
  install something.apk", "am start ...".  Script activity and intent
  management using robust tools.

+ Attach a local gdb to an android process.  This is tons eaiser than
  messing with gdbserver and for simple debugging just as good (you
  will need to copy unstripped libraries into /system/lib to get debug
  info, and the glibc-based gdb doesn't seem to understand bionic
  threads, so you will have to attach to the specific thread you
  want).

+ netstat, iptables, tcpdump, iwconfig/iwlist

+ {TODO} Launch a dalvik app under valgrind with "valgrind app_process ..."

+ {TODO} Mount the android filesystem locally via sshfs
