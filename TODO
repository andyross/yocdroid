+ Move to a loopback-mounted filesystem image instead of a directory.
  The recursive bind mount of /data is just too dangerous.  It also
  has the advantage of not requiring tar/bzip2 at install time and can
  eliminate the bootstrap busybox dependency.  Alternatively, consider
  putting the root in a tmpfs.  Similarly: use a remount -o
  suid,exec,dev on filesystems bind mounted from /data

+ Similarly separate a mostly-read-only root from volatiles like
  /home, /var such that the root can be replaced without wiping the
  system.  Get this mostly for free with an ext4 image.

+ Android userid unification.  Add a /home/shell while at it and
  integrate with the install-ssh step.  One way to do this is directly
  manipulating the passwd/group files in the base-passwd package, but
  investigate the glibc nss interface for a slicker solution.
  Amusingly, the list is statically defined (in C code!) in
  system/core/include/private/android_filesystem_config.h.

+ Come up with a recipe for running dalvik UI apps outside of zygote,
  or maybe just of restarting zygote inside the chroot.

+ dmidecode recipe

+ Figure out valgrind's error with /system/bin/linker.  Apparently
  this should work per the valgrind site.

+ Make non-arch links for the binutils binaries so the user can do
  e.g. "readelf" instead of "$ARCH-readelf" on the target.

+ Turn off UseDNS in the sshd config

+ tmux recipe?  I hate screen...

+ Figure out logwrapper for mountd
