+ Bootstrap installation which requires just root access for a single
  toolbox-based script.

+ Add a cgroups-based "stop" utility to reliably shutdown the
  yocdroid environment and remove all the bind mounts.

+ netlink solution to detect mount/umount events and maintain the bind
  mounts dynamically

+ Come up with a recipe for running dalvik UI apps

+ dmidecode recipe

+ Figure out valgrind's error with /system/bin/linker.  Apparently
  this should work per the valgrind site.

+ Make non-arch links for the binutils binaries so the user can do
  e.g. "readelf" on the target.

+ Put the root in a tmpfs, bind mounting /data/y such that it can be
  remounted suid.

+ Fix "make install" to work with both AOSP (weird) and Cyanogenmod
  (more typical) "su" binaries.

+ Android userid unification.  Add a /home/shell while at it and
  integrate with the install-ssh step.
