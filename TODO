+ Move to a loopback-mounted filesystem image instead of a directory.
  The recursive bind mount of /data is just too dangerous.
  Alternatively put the root in a tmpfs.  Similarly: use a remount -o
  suid,exec,dev on the yocdroid rootfs if it's mounted from /data

+ Similarly separate a mostly-read-only root from volatiles like
  /home, /var such that the root can be replaced without wiping the
  system.

+ netlink solution to detect mount/umount events and maintain the bind
  mounts dynamically

+ Come up with a recipe for running dalvik UI apps

+ dmidecode recipe

+ Figure out valgrind's error with /system/bin/linker.  Apparently
  this should work per the valgrind site.

+ Make non-arch links for the binutils binaries so the user can do
  e.g. "readelf" instead of "$ARCH-readelf" on the target.

+ Android userid unification.  Add a /home/shell while at it and
  integrate with the install-ssh step.  One way to do this is directly
  manipulating the passwd/group files, but investigate the glibc nss
  interface for a slicker solution.

+ yocdroid-run should check for and start the environment if it's not
  already running

+ Make yocdroid-stop run from inside the environment.  Would need to
  create a cgroup directory for itself and exit the yocdroid one;
  might need portability work to run with /bin/sh vs. AOSP.  Bonus
  points for hooking the initscripts.
