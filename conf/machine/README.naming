Openembedded/Yocto images do not really have a clean notion of an
"architecture" as distinct from a "machine" (rather: they do, but it's
an internal thing).  We can only control the latter via configuration,
but must avoid collisions with the names of the former.  So the
machine names here are (uselessly) prepended with a "yd-".  It's not
possible to have a "MACHINE=x86" setting unfortunately.
